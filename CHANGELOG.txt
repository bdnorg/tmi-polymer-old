- Initial test framework
--- First commit
- keys: basic iron-a11y-keys work
- menu: basics work
- pointer: basics work
--- commit

--- commit
- Factored into elements: tmi-menu, tmi-browser
- switched to Mousetrap
- added _.bindAll and cleaned key mapping functions.
- added search
--- commit

- hide windows w/o search matches.
- get rid of viewModel.  Just use viewTabs in nodes.

---- head

! add a named win to test (and make search work on name)
  ! search: if matches win it should show even if viewTabs.length === 0
! decide on right() behavior (point to active?, right again?)
0 name wintabs, m, save/open in bookmarks, css, more in bg,   id naming, refactor(kill initApp, remove extra loads), optimize all,
0 id-# vs. id.  Save LRU tabs.
? saving pointer state in nodes.
- tab count and selected count at top
- make bg work outside extension (with the mocks). (no global functions)
- global moch for chrome.*
- two copies of app.js in dist
? move initApp into tmi-browser?
- don't load extra stuff(unused elements, mocks, duplicate in vulcanized)
- reverse order of unpinned wins.
- make generic tree of nodes element
- numbers goto without pressing '
- fix and test treeQuery...
! make g,G work with tabs in search

--- Todo
- things like istab should be in the model, not just the dom
+ tmi-browser component: update from real tabs
- storage: data model, link stored to real, use bookmarks
- mark: fix singlequote key event, implement getOneKey()
- name: get input working
- search: filter
- create pinned section, get rid of ::shadow queries
- keys: data scructure, broken{? / ...}, wrappers, multikey sequences, different trees, make help/keys an element
- menu: toolbar too big, FOUC, onclicks work,
- pointer: initial pointer. point to collections(pin, closed)

- styles: global, make pretty, fix in gulp->extension
- gulp: clean up, minify, uglify,
- extension: clean manifest.
- dynamic docs
- labels
- auto close

--- Issues
- why does this make nodes become undefined?
    <template is="dom-repeat" items="{{nodes}}" as="node">

- want observers.  this.set('coll.key.feild', value). key should be a variable,not a hardcoded string
- want deep selector: like to walk a tree
  - or stamp more into element's light dom but still get polymer's binding goodness
- querySelector doesn't work on id's beginning w/ number
- want object observer: observing a path(e.g. user.manager) requires set
- get parentElement across shadow boundaries.
