- style is broken
--- commit


--- Todo
- remove /deep/
+ tmi-browser component: update from real tabs
- storage: data model, link stored to real, use bookmarks
- mark: fix singlequote key event, implement getOneKey()
- name: get input working
- search: filter
- create pinned section, get rid of ::shadow queries
- keys: data scructure, broken{? / ...}, wrappers, multikey sequences, different trees, make help/keys an element
- menu: toolbar too big, FOUC, onclicks work,
- pointer: initial pointer. point to collections(pin, closed)

- styles: global, make pretty, fix in gulp->extension
- gulp: clean up, minify, uglify, 
- extension: clean manifest.
- dynamic docs
- labels
- auto close

--- Issues
- why does this make nodes become undefined?
    <template is="dom-repeat" items="{{nodes}}" as="node">

- want observers.  this.set('coll.key.feild', value). key should be a variable,not a hardcoded string
- want deep selector: like to walk a tree
  - or stamp more into element's light dom but still get polymer's binding goodness
- querySelector doesn't work on id's beginning w/ number
- want object observer: observing a path(e.g. user.manager) requires set
- get parentElement across shadow boundaries.
