--- commit
- implemented pin window (shift-o)
- update SDK and merge
--- commit

  - added crisper, removed uglify and minify.
- removed routing (was broken in extension)
- style is broken
--- commit
- Changed keyMap
- Added background.js
- Added freezing.
--- commit

--- commit
- changed up/down movement to be in same level
- implemented bookmark and close
#! working version - prior to jstree exp1-3.
--- commit
- reverted after jstree / exp3.
- added mark / goto / 0-9
--- commit
- y sends tab to mark / new win.
- Fixed keys being intercepted in search.
- up / down transitions across wins and tabs
--- commit

---- head

--- Todo
## tree interface:: downward: draw model. search(?). getVisibleNodes.
  # toggle/un/select, get/clearSelected, id2node, left/right?
  # get/setPointer. nextprevVisible. collapse/expand. closePopup.
  # upward: user clicked/doubleclicked/selected/uncollapsed.
## app interface
  # upward: user clicked/doubleclicked/selected/uncollapsed.
  # which use dom query:
! marking 1-5 doesn't clear default 1-5. can be dups. reverse keys/vals in marks.
! fix tests
! fix menu
0 make hybrid wins: real win + bookmarked win.
0 pin: move pinned wins in tree. spacer between pinned.
0 save order/marks across sessions
0 publish in store.
1 start with active win closed.  At start, show only active tab under win.
  - graphically show: # tabs, 1st and active tab, tabs w/ a mark.
  - show extra win info for pointer ()
0 win names
0 dedup on save bookmarks. add date.
0 open bookmarks. search bookmarks.
  - wins w/ some tabs open and some bookemarked.
0 find dup URLs.  find like domains.  google search also shows saved/open urls.
- better J/K g/G. jump to bottom/top of screen
- be consistent on moving tree nodes vs. wintab mgmt.
  - Left on win to lock movement of wintab (like tivo).
- right goes to pointer position at previous "left" key, or active, or first tab.
- open vs point to (via shift key?).
- refactor: polymerObj should be defined in a function with local variables.
  - biz logic separate from tree el. centralize biz logic.
  - combine biz logic of tmi-tree and app.js move to background.js.
  - use model everywhere. consistency on using els.  mock chrome.* better.
- clean up console.logs
1 right in search (only goes to active tab). test.
- redraw after pin?
- css,
- faster initial draw, optimize all,
3 generic tree element (ludwig)
- id-# vs. id.
- Bookmark LRU tabs. superstars.
- add chrome.sessions support for restoring closed wintabs.
- ? use chrome.history to match open wins with saved wins?
2 move app.js to elements. get rid of initApp.
0 movement + {shift: jump, ctrl: bring tab? select?}.
  - jump: within level: {top, pin, active, bottom}
  # right: right toggle, again to active?
    - right-again: jump to top/bottom/active? open all? open tab details?
  # up/down only at same level?
- names: input, search(test), save
! search: if matches win (name) it should show even if viewTabs.length === 0
- make sure not running polyfill (see WebComponentsReady)
- selected count at top
1 don't load extra stuff(unused elements, mocks, duplicate in vulcanized)
3 make generic tree of nodes element
- fix and test treeQuery...
1 esc -> start over (clear search and begin at tab even when not in search mode)
1 make menu work
1 close popup after changing wintabs state
3 things like istab/type should be in the model, not just the dom

- keys: multiple trees, make menu/keys an element
- collections(pin, closed)
- styles: global, make pretty, fix in gulp->extension
- gulp: clean up, minify, uglify,
2 extension: clean manifest.
- dynamic docs
- labels
- auto close

--- Issues
- want deep selector: like to walk a tree
  - or stamp more into element's light dom but still get polymer's binding goodness
- get parentElement across shadow boundaries.
