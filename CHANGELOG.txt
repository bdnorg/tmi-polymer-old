- Polymer Starter Kit
- Display test data
- Framework for keys and commands
- Initial test framework
--- First commit
- keys: basic iron-a11y-keys work
- menu: basics work
- pointer: basics work
--- commit
- menu: space toggles,
- pointer: collapse from tab, wrap around, api to set, pointer is el
--- commit
- better pointer tests
--- commit
- initial tmi-browser and sync with wins
--- commit


--- Todo
- create pinned section, get rid of ::shadow queries
+ tmi-browser: make component, update from real tabs
- storage: data model, link stored to real, use bookmarks
- search
- keys: data scructure, broken{? / ...}, wrappers, multikey sequences, different trees
- menu: toolbar too big, FOUC, onclicks work,
- pointer: initial pointer. point to collections(pin, closed)

- styles: global, make pretty
- dynamic docs
- labels
- auto close

--- Issues
- why does this make nodes become undefined?
    <template is="dom-repeat" items="{{nodes}}" as="node">

- want observers.  this.set('coll.key.feild', value). key should be a variable,not a hardcoded string
- want deep selector: like to walk a tree
  - or stamp more into element's light dom but still get polymer's binding goodness
- querySelector doesn't work on id's beginning w/ number
- want object observer: observing a path(e.g. user.manager) requires set
- get parentElement across shadow boundaries.
